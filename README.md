`Just hello :)`

## 🚪👋 Knock knock?!

I am fine with you:

- Just saying hello and have nothing specific to discuss
- Starting an IM session with "Hello, are you around?", "Have a sec?" or the classic "ping"
- Reaching out with a greeting and then taking two minutes to ask me something

I am likely not looking at the IM window in real time unless I have nothing else to do...

Asynchronous communication is awkward and unproductive. I am not here to fix that problem. I am interested in fixing other problems though. So if you have Defender for Identity challenges, Sentinel problems, authentication errors... I want to fix those ❤️‍🔥

🗒️ PS. I fully understand and respect the people who want the opposite of that, and embrace the "nohello" philosophy. I have found it a bit intimidating sometimes. But eh 🤷‍♂️
